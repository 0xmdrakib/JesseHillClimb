# Remix deployment (Base mainnet)

Deploy **two** contracts on Base mainnet:

1) `JesseHillClimbScoreboard.sol`
2) `JesseHillClimbRunNFT.sol`

## Steps

1. Open Remix.
2. Create two files and paste the contract code.
3. In "Deploy & Run Transactions":
   - Environment: **Injected Provider** (your wallet)
   - Network: **Base mainnet** (chainId 8453)
4. Deploy:
   - Scoreboard has no constructor args.
   - RunNFT has no constructor args.
5. Copy deployed addresses and put them in your `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SCOREBOARD_ADDRESS=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_RUNNFT_ADDRESS=0x...
```

## Notes
- `submitScore(meters)` always emits an event, but only updates `bestMeters[address]` if the submitted meters is higher.
- `mintRun(meters, driverId, tokenURI)` mints sequential tokenIds: 1,2,3...
